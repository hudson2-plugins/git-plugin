    Which strategy to use when selecting revision for building.
    Default will search HEADs for different branches as described below:
    <ul>
        <li>If only one branch is chosen and only one repository is listed, then just attempt to find the latest
            revision number for the chosen branch.
        </li>
        <li>If multiple branches are selected or the branches include wildcards, then use the advanced usecase as
            defined:
        </li>
        <ol>
            <li>Find all the branch revisions</li>
            <li>Filter out branches that we don't care about from the revisions. Any Revisions with no interesting
                branches are dropped.
            </li>
            <li>Get rid of any revisions that are wholly subsumed by another revision we're considering.</li>
            <li>Get rid of any revisions that we've already built.</li>
        </ol>
    </ul>
