  If set, and Hudson is set to poll for changes, Hudson will honor any files and/or
  folders in this list when determining if a build needs to be triggered.
  <p/>
  Each inclusion uses regular expression pattern matching, and must be separated by a new line.
  An empty list implies that everything is included.
  <p/>
  <pre>
       myapp/src/main/web/.*\.html
       myapp/src/main/web/.*\.jpeg
       myapp/src/main/web/.*\.gif
  </pre>
  The example above illustrates that a build will only occur, if html/jpeg/gif files
  have been committed to the SCM. If there is an overlap between included and excluded
  regions, exclusions take precedence over inclusions.
